#### Target Player Exerience

We wish to make the player both laugh but at the same time also be scared. The game shall emulate horror game feelings, but parody it at the same time.

#### Core Diagram

1.  Core Mechaninc

    -   Walking in a 3D space through a first person view

2.  Secondary Mechancis

    -   Pick up collectable items and keep them
    -   Interact with objects to change the surrounding area


3.  Progression

    -   You will complete the game if you collect all items. And as you progress to show that you are progressing, the ragdoll skeleton will get launched harder or faster.

4.  Narrative

    -   A dead man at the graveyard that you tend to can not find peace and is stuck on this mortal plane. His skeleton is upset about this fact and is taking his anger out on you. But since skeletons don't have muscles he can't walk, so instead he just throws himself at you. This will be the source of most comedy as the skeleton will be ragdoll.

#### Minimal Viable Interaction

First person controller in a scene with at least one object that can be interacted with and one object that can be "picked up" such that they disappear and the game remembers you have pick an item up. And there is an "enemy" that directly follows you with  no pathfinding.

#### References

Pease add a short description of how this is relevant to your game (mechanic, art, theme, etc.). There is no limit to how many references you can have.
