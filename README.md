#### Core Diagram

1.  Core Mechaninc

    -   The core mechanic in a game will usually be the purposeful interaction that occurs the most frequently. In a platforming game, this is usually jumping. In a shooter, it is usually shooting. In a racing game, it will be driving. Another way to determine the core mechanic is, if without it, you wouldnâ€™t be able to play the game at all.

2.  Secondary Mechancis

    -   The secondary mechanics are the interactions that happen less frequently. They could even be layered out from more frequent to least frequent.
    -   List each


3.  Progression

    -   Progression systems form the mechanical envelope of the game, being the source of change within the game system at a holistic level.

4.  Narrative

    -   The Narrative layer is the outer most layer that puts all the inner layers within it into context.

#### Minimal Viable Interaction

First person controller in a scene with at least one object that can be interacted with and one object that can be "picked up" such that they disappear and the game remembers you have pick an item up. And there is an "enemy" that directly follows you with  no pathfinding.

#### References

Pease add a short description of how this is relevant to your game (mechanic, art, theme, etc.). There is no limit to how many references you can have.
